### Class Pruning
This repository contains code for pruning a pre-trained model to only classify a subset of classes. 
For example, if you have a model that classifies 1000 classes, but you only want to classify 10 of them, you can use this code to prune the model to only classify those 10 classes.

As a use case, the Panama model will be pruned to only classify the BCI species.
